# :star_struck: Lindsey's Stirling :violin: Resume
My very own personal website.  Basically this is just a rÃ©sumÃ© of an American violinist, singer, songwriter, and dancer. This project should help other fans to get more information about her life in an easy and comfortable way to look at. I believe that it is important to save life details of great people for coming future generations, so let it be one of the copies to help her image live forever.
